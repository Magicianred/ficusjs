# IE11 FicusJS example

This example builds a bundle specifically for IE11. This would also apply to other legacy browsers that do not support ES6 or web components natively.

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Build the bundle and serve:

```sh
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:5000 in IE11
