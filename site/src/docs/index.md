# FicusJS documentation

FicusJS is a set of lightweight functions for developing applications using web components.

## What are web components?

Web components are a set of browser APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags for use in websites and web applications.
Web Components work across modern browsers and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.

## Go build-less

Browsers have improved a lot over the past years. It's now possible to do web development without requiring any build tools, using the native module loader of the browser. We think this is a great fit for FicusJS, and we recommend this as a general starting point.

## Aligns with standards

FicusJS aligns with standard browser APIs which means it is not based on any proprietary code or libraries.

As it is based on standards, it has longevity and is a good choice for enterprise web applications.

## Why ficus?

Ficus, pronounced _fick-us_, trees are a common plant in the home and office, mainly because they look like a typical tree with a single trunk which spreads into a canopy of leaves.
This is similar to a web application with a spread of web components!
